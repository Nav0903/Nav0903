Metro Brews, a growing coffee chain, has successfully opened three locations, in New York City over the past six months. To support expansion the company aims to assess its performance and develop strategies to drive growth and improve decision making. The leadership team wants to analyze the performance data to create strategies for growth and decision making. In my role as Senior Data Analyst at Metro Brews, I am responsible for examining sales data in Tableau to uncover insights that will help enhance the business forward. The focus of this analysis is on three major objectives: understanding which store locations are performing best, identifying the product categories that generate the most revenue, and examining how sales trends differ by Month.
